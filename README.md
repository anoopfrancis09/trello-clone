This app have used only basic features from Trello app to show how it can be built using simple Javascript and React without any 3rd party libraries.

- Application consist of one main page where the user can see thei added boards(column) and tasks(cards) in those boards.
- They can rearrange the cards from one board to another by simply dragging and dropping it on the - respective boards.
- Also user can edit the card content by clicking on the cards.
- Onclick, they will be shown a new popup view to edit the details.

## Future implementations planned

As the application is a clone for trello app, there are a lot of feature that are not added o this app but which I plan to add may be in the coming future releases. Those are listed below.

- Use images as the banner for cards.
- Rearrange the cards within a column.
- Board/column deletion when ever user likes to.
- More features added to the card so that the user could edit those in the card edit screen.
- Also we could sent out a reminder emails whenever some tasks due date is within the coming two days or so.
- We can add watchers to cards so that whenevr some edit happens on the card/task, those watchers will get an notification on the changes.
- We can have a home page where we can show different group of boards, as a summary and upon click of each board groups, user can be navigated to the particular board group and see all the boards and cards on that group.
